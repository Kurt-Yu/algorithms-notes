# Algorithms Notes and Templates for Coding Interviews

## About this book
- This book can be considered as a solution manual for leetcode.
- I used to spend many days and nights solving questions randomly on leetcode, but that doesn't help me master coding interviews or getting offers from my dream companies.
- I couldn't solve problems from real interview even though I did the same problems a few months ago.
- Until I start to organize the problems in a more structural way and learn to summarize common patterns from them.
- This book is about this. Questions are organized by tags and templates will be provided.
- Hopefully this can help you master coding interview in the shortest time.
- This book is free and will always be free. But please consider [donating](donating.md) if you find it useful. That means a lot to me : )
